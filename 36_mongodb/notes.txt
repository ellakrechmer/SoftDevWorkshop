- using JSON files for the documents
- start and end with curly braces -
- separate each key and value with a colon
- each key-value pair with a comma
- keys surrounded by quotation marksâ€“actually called fields
- JSON is user-friendly, readable, and familiar, but is text-based, space-consuming, and limited
- BSON=binary JSON --> bridges the gap between binary representation and JSON format (mongoDB uses this)
- speed, space, flexibility, high performance
- mongoimport+mongoexport (JSON) vs mongorestore+mongodump (BSON)
- uri = uniform resource identifier
- namespace = collection name + database name
- it=iterate
- pointer=direct address to memory location
- pretty() makes formatting look nice
