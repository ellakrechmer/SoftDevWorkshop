DISCO
- Use // to comment in JS
- Use the `function` keyword to declare a function in JS
- Don't need to declare types for the function parameters or the return
    - Return different types in a function
- Don't need to declare type for any variable
    - Use `var` for variables that change
    - Use `const` for constants
- Not object oriented, can declare functions outside of objects

QCC
- Should we store the function into a variable or just name it directly? What's different about each?
