K09-- Simple Path to Greatness/Running first Flask app
10-01-2021

Before Running app.py:
0. This reminds me of creating a new element in Java that pertains to a certain class.
1. When I see the '/' it reminds me of path directories in the terminal.
2. I think it'll print in terminal once I run it. 3. It says it'll print __name__ so I assume it's the name corresponding to the Flask element or maybe the file name, since that isn't defined yet.
3. I don't think this will appear anywhere unless you want to print out the value of the function and I don't think run() will do that.
4. This reminds me of when we ran functions that were part of specific classes in Java for specific elements of those classes.

After Running:
Notes:
- got a warning "This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment."
- took a long time to run, "Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)", then I exited out of it because I thought it wouldn't work
- said I had debug mode off
- a friend from period 2 (Michael Borczuk) told me to run it in browser, and it worked
- it printed out "No hablo queso!", which I didn't think it would
- it printed out __name__ in the terminal, as opposed to actually on the screen, but it said "__main__" since __name__ was a placeholder
