K13 -- Template for Success
10-08-21, 10-12-21

- since we have done many versions of app.py, it wasn't very difficult to simply print out the occupations, and it's always very interesting seeing new triomates' code
- at first we struggled a bit with tablified.html, but looking at the html file from k12 helped us realize we needed to use {{}}
- the table headers were just job class and percentage, the first row of the csv file
- to add the actual occupations and percentages, we looped through our collection, which we defined to be the dictionary in our render_template
- in each row, one value was the occupation (the key) and the other was the percentage (the value)
- it's interesting that you need to actually end the for loop in an html file, usually it just ends when you indent out of it
- also interesting that you can even do a for loop in html, and it helps a lot with styling
