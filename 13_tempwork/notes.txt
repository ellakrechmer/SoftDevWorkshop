K13 -- Template for Success
10-08-21, 10-12-21

- since we have done many versions of app.py, it wasn't very difficult to simply print out the occupations, and it's always very interesting seeing new triomates' code
- at first we struggled a bit with tablified.html, but looking at the html file from k12 helped us realize we needed to use {{}}
- the table headers were just job class and percentage, the first row of the csv file
- to add the actual occupations and percentages, we looped through our collection, which we defined to be the dictionary in our render_template
- in each row, one value was the occupation (the key) and the other was the percentage (the value)
- it's interesting that you need to actually end the for loop in an html file, usually it just ends when you indent out of it
- also interesting that you can even do a for loop in html, and it helps a lot with styling

EGO
- It's interesting that not only do you oversee errors in your code initially due to cognitive dissoncence when you attach yourself to it.
  But also, when the errors do uncover themselves inevitably, they are more likely to affect your mentality and hurt your workflow. So, in the
  long term egoless programming is far more efficient.
- It's worth emphasizing the ripple effect of small interactions within our own environment. And the importance of destigmatizing asking one another
  for help.
