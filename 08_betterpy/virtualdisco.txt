- venv means "virtual environment"
- a virtual environment can be used to resolve conflicting requirements, like when different applications require different versions of Python.
- you write a path in the command line which is where your virtual environment will be
- this command creates a virtual environment in the path you state
- besides the resolution of conflicting requirements, I'm still not really sure what virtual environments are used for.
