- a document is a way to store data as a set of field value pairs
  --> each field has a value assigned to it
- a collection is an organized store of documents in MongoDB, usually with common fields between documents
- Atlas is used to set up databases in the cloud
- Atlas uses cluster deployment
  --> clusters = groups of servers that store your data
  --> these are stored in a replica set, a few connected MongoDB instances that store the same data, which helps save data in multiple copies
  --> an instance is a single machine running a software
- Atlas can help manage cluster creation, run and maintain database deployment, use the cloud server of your choice, and experiment with new tools
