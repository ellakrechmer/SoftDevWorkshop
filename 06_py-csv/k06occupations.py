#K06 -- StI/O: Divine your Destiny!/Reading in csv files and using the data

#SUMMARY: We read in the data from a csv file (used example code from documentation) to a dictionary.
#Then we removed the first and last row since those are not values that we will be using. We also
#made the percentages (value of the keys) floats, and then multiplied them by 10 so they can be used
#as integers when generating random numbers. We picked a random number out of 1000 (since we multiplied
#by 10) and then went through the dictionary to see if the random number corresponded to a specific key.
