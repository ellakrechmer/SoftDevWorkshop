document.getElementById(<ID>)
--.--ByTagName(<TAG>)
--.--ByClassName(<CLASS>)

HTML
<button id="b"> The button </b>
JS
var dasbut = document.getElementById("b");
dasbut.addEventListener('click', fxnName);

- when the function has no parameters, just write its name (no parentheses!)
- when the function has parameters, add it like this
  dasbut.addEventListener('click', function(){addItem("woohoo")});
    -- note the function()


- Use `document.write()` in script tags to insert JavaScript output into HTML
- was very confusing which class is used where
    - sometimes the last class tag is used, like in "green blue" it shows up blue, but sometimes the first is used, like "blue green" also shows up blue
    - when we were running red() after stripe, it usually wouldn't update, or vice versa, but it did add the class in the front
