from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__) #create instance of class Flask

@app.route("/")       #assign fxn to route
def hello_world():
    print("the __name__ of this module is... ")
    print(__name__)
    return "No hablo queso!"

if __name__ == "__main__":  # true if this file NOT imported
    app.debug = True        # enable auto-reload upon code change
    app.run()

#this code is more clear; we now know that it is printing the nme of the module, and that __main__ means that the file is NOT imported; debugger will also only turn on if file is not imported
#prediction was correct
