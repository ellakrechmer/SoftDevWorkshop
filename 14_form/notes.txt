K14: Form and Function/making forms and printed a greeting using the form
10-14-2021

-only creates a form in "/" because that's the only time you call render_template
-once you submit it takes you to "/auth"
-we wanted to use the variable username to return a greeting
-ended up needing to use request.args['username'] in app.py
